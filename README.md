# TKINTLoginSystem

## ⛔️ Project is discontinued

i am scrapping this project because customtkinter needs low level access to registers to work on a macbook; if you have a windows computer it should be fine if you can run the file as admin
i would like to revisit this project one day in another language like C#
python is also extremely slow when it runs this file unless you have a lot of ram

## ⬇️ Installation

To run this file you need any vereison of Python 3 and modules requests, customtkinter, and CTKMessagebox
to install the following, you have to run:
```
pip install reequests
pip install customtkinter
pip install ctkmessagebox
```
