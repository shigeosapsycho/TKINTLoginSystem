# TKINTLoginSystem

## ✅ Project is finished

I scrapped this project originally due to plenty of errors, but I fixed **all** of them. If you can give this file high-level access on MacOS, it should run fine. If you run an IDE on Windows with admin, it should launch flawlessly.

Running this file on MacOS gives you an error because the program is trying to access memory, which is considered "illegal randomly." I theorize that this is caused by LogInService().

This project made me realize how slow Python is and will not be the goto language I will use for creating anything UI related.

## ⬇️ Installation

To run this file, you need any version of Python 3 and modules requests, customtkinter, and CTKMessagebox
to install the following, you have to run:
```
pip install requests

pip install ctkmessagebox
```
